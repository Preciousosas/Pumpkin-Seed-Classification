## Pumpkin-Seed-Classification
This project is a Kaggle project. I engaged in the project to improve my data science knowledge-

# INTRODUCTION
Pumpkin seeds are frequently consumed as confection worldwide because of their adequate amount of protein, fat, carbohydrate, and mineral contents. This study was carried out on the two most important and quality types of pumpkin seeds, ‘‘Urgup_Sivrisi’’ and ‘‘Cercevelik’’, generally grown in Urgup and Karacaoren regions in Turkey. However, morphological measurements of 2500 pumpkin seeds of both varieties were made possible by using the gray and binary forms of threshold techniques. Considering morphological features, all the data were modeled with four different machine learning methods: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), which further determined the most successful method for classifying pumpkin seed varieties.

# Notes
Code two and three were used to load the dataset into the notebook on Kaggle (P.S This code is not needed if you are using a notebook other than Kaggle).
